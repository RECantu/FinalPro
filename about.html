                Hi, I'm Roman Cantu!  
                This website is a showcase of my personal favorite games right now. I have been a game addict for about my whole life. I remember when my father introduced me to my first ever game back in 2008. It was called Space Invaders. Ever since that, I was invested in gaming! I pretty much love all types of genre in games. 
                Join me on this gaming journey!
